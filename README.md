### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tim Uruski, my pronouns are he/him. Iâ€™m a programmer living in [Inglewood, Calgary, Alberta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_Calgary). During the day I work as a developer for [TMDB](https://themoviedb.org/). I occasionally blog at [tim.uru.ski](https://tim.uru.ski) and I spend my free time reading about science and mathematics, cooking and baking bread, and boxing. I previously co-organized the local Ruby developers group [YYC Ruby](https://www.meetup.com/YYC-dev/) and volunteered as an instructor for [programming classes and workshops](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca).
